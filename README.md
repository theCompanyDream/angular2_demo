# MindFul Coding

I get a lot of anxiety when coding sometimes it could be simple things over what to write to more complicated things like what if I break something. It's not easy to explain but sometimes coding blocks can happen. This is a reminder to myself that they can happen and that even the smallest commits can make the biggest differennces. Anyways Let's see what this becomes.

## Installation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). This project also uses yarn to add projects. In order to run this you need to follow a few simple steps.

1. `npm install -g yarn`
2. clone repo
3. cd `<target-directory>`
4. `yarn`

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
